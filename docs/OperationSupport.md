# hipDNN Operation Support

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the operations currently supported in hipDNN and the details of their implementation support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **hipDNN is in the early phase of development.** The operation support table below reflects the current state of the library. We are actively working on expanding support for additional operations and features.

## Current Operation Support

The following table lists all operations currently supported in hipDNN:

| Operation | Datatypes | Layouts | Plugin | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Batchnorm Backward  | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Spatial mode only¹ |
| Batchnorm Inference + DRelu + Backward | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Fused graph³ |
| Batchnorm Training  | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Spatial mode only¹ |
| Convolution Dgrad   | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Cross-correlation only² |
| Convolution Forward | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Cross-correlation only² |
| Convolution Wgrad   | FP16, BFP16, FP32 | NCHW, NHWC, NCDHW, NDHWC | MIOpen | Cross-correlation only² |

## Operation Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **Batchnorm Operations:** Currently, only spatial batchnorm mode is supported. Spatial mode computes statistics over the batch (N) and spatial dimensions (H, W, or D, H, W) for each channel.

> [!NOTE]
> **Convolution Operations:** Currently, only cross-correlation convolutions are supported. True mathematical convolution (with kernel flipping) is not yet implemented. In practice, cross-correlation is the standard operation used in modern deep learning frameworks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fused Operations:** The Batchnorm Inference + Activation Backward operation is a fused graph pattern that combines three operations: (1) Batchnorm Inference, (2) Activation Backward (DReLU), and (3) Batchnorm Backward.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sparse Support:** All operations currently work with dense tensors only. Sparse tensor support is planned for future releases.
